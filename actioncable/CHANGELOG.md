## Rails 5.0.0.beta3 (February 24, 2016) ##

*   Added `em_redis_connector` and `redis_connector` to
   `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::EventedRedis` and added `redis_connector`
    to `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::Redis`, so you can overwrite with your
    own initializers. This is used when you want to use different-than-standard
    Redis adapters, like for Makara distributed Redis.

*   Create notion of an `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter`.
    Separate out Redis functionality into
    `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::Redis`, and add a
    PostgreSQL adapter as well. Configuration file for
    ActionCable was changed from`config/redis/cable.yml` to
    `config/cable.yml`.
